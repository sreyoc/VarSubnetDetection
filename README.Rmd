# VarSubnetDetection
This supports the detection and analysis of altered subnetworks for epilepsy mutations using the hierarchical hotnet algorithm [@reyna2018hierarchical][https://github.com/raphael-group/hierarchical-hotnet.git]. The two WES epilepsy datasets CoGIE and EpiPGX were analyzed in the study [@may2018rare] and the loss-of-function and Non-synonmyous mutations were considered in this study.

# Implementation details
The datasets were received in-house. The analysis was carried out in two parts. 

- In the first part, subnetworks and genes were detected for the above-mentioned datasets using the HPC cluster Iris at the University of Luxembourg [@VBCG_HPCS14].

- In the second part, over-representation of detected genes and networks were further analyzed via the clusterProfiler [@clusterProfiler] functions in R.
